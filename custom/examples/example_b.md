# User 

To get the user that has logged in and to use the data to sign a transaction do the following:

1. After setting up a scene as explained [here](https://liquiidio.gitbook.io/unity-plugin-suite/v/universalauthenticatorlibrary/examples/example_a), add a memeber of type `User`

2. Create a new method (which should match the one called by the action in the [getting started](https://liquiidio.gitbook.io/unity-plugin-suite/v/universalauthenticatorlibrary/examples/example_a) section) and pass a `User` parameter.

3. Then assign the parameter to the variable of type `User`
