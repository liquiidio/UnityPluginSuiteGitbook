# Getting Started

## **Ready to start your Developer-C**areer **on WAX?!**

\
At the top left, next to the "Unity Plugin Suite" header, you will find a menu with entries for each individual package, which will take you to dedicated pages for each package.

There you will find

* Detailed instructions on various installation options and dependencies of individual packages
* Various examples with additional explanations
* Complete documentation of each package, its classes, methods, members and so on (_"API Docs"_-Subsection).
* If you are looking for a specific information, use the searchbar in the upper right corner and if you don't find what you are searching for, feel free to contact us on Telegram or file an issue in the corresponding repository (our prefered way).
