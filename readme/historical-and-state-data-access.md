# Historical and State Data access

[Hyperion](https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io/) the most commonly used API allowing developers to access/query historical and state data of leap-based blockchains.

* See [Hyperion History Api](../sources/hyperion.md) to learn how to access/query historical and state-data.



[EosSharp](https://github.com/liquiidio/EosSharp) C#-based implementation of eos-js, used to access state data and to communicate with Leap-Nodes and their RPC-Endpoints (push transactions, query table-data and more)

* See [EosSharp](../sources/eos\_sharp.md) to learn how to query state-data, how to serialize or deserialize data and objects and how to access the Leap-Nodes RPC-Endpoints
