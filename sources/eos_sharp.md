# EosSharp

C# client library for EOSIO blockchains. The library is based on https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs, initially developed by [Scatter](https://github.com/GetScatter) and [MÃ¡rio Silva](https://github.com/mmcs85), it's MIT licensed and in the meantime maintained by liquiid.io.

\
EosSharp provides the necessary functionallity to serialize and deserialize data (C# Objects or Dictionaries) into a format that which Leap-Nodes (previously EOSIO, Nodeos is the Blockchain-Node-Software) understand. \
\
It also allows to communicate with Nodeos RPC-Service to send and receive data like Table-Rows, Transactions, Actions, ABIs etc.
