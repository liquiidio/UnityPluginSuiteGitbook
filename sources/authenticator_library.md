# Authenticator Library

A native UAL allowing the use of supported SignatureProviders, similar to the js-based UAL allowing developers and users the same interaction flow and UI/UX on all different platforms. The priority of this plugin is for user and developer experience, while building the same base with extension-capabilities allowing to support additional SignatureProviders like Wombat, MetaMask, AIKON, other Wallets or SideChain-Auth in the future.
