# Introduction

#### What is the UAL

A native UAL (Universal Authenticator Library) allowing the use of supported SignatureProviders, similar to the js-based UAL initially developed by Block.one, allowing developers and users the same interaction flow and UI/UX on all different platforms. \
\
The priority of this plugin is for user and developer experience, while building the same base with extension-capabilities allowing to support additional SignatureProviders like Wombat, MetaMask, AIKON, other Wallets or SideChain-Auth in the future.\
\
The AuthenticatorLibrary currently supports [WAX Cloud Wallet](https://wallet.wax.io/) and [Anchor Wallet](https://www.greymass.com/anchor)
